Description: Massive multi-user 3D game environments library (shared library)
 This is a software platform for creating and running massively multi-user
 entertainment in a 3D environment over the Internet.
 .
 This library is further divided into specific modules: network, ai, 3d
 and misc. If you want to use any of these, you also need to use the misc
 part of the library, but ai, 3d and network are totally independent from
 each other so you can use only the parts you really need in your project.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
